## Ecommerce-Follow-Along
# Milestone 1: Project Overview
This project is a step-by-step guide to building a complete e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It covers essential functionalities like user authentication, product management, and order processing. Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience working with RESTful APIs, designing database schemas, and developing a dynamic frontend with React.

Core Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT.
Product Management: Full CRUD functionality, including sorting and filtering.
Order System: Users can place orders and track their history.
REST API Development: Scalable API endpoints to manage users, products, and orders.
Frontend Design: A responsive UI built with React for a seamless shopping experience.
Tech Stack:
MongoDB
Express.js
React.js
Node.js
JWT for secure authentication
REST API
3 Milestone 2: Initial Setup & Login Page
Established a well-structured project directory.
Created a React app to serve as the frontend.
Configured a Node.js server to handle backend operations.
Integrated Tailwind CSS for a modern and efficient styling workflow.
Installed useful development tools and extensions.
Designed and implemented a functional, styled login page for the frontend.
# Milestone 3: Backend Structure & Database Integration
Organized backend code into dedicated folders for better maintainability.
Set up a Node.js server to process API requests.
Established a connection to MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
Implemented foundational error handling to improve backend stability.
# Milestone 4: User Model & File Uploads
Developed a User Model to define the structure of user-related data in the database.
Created a User Controller to handle actions like retrieving and storing user data.
Configured Multer to manage file uploads, allowing users to store images and other files.
# Milestone 5: Signup Page (Frontend)
Built a React-based signup page with a user-friendly form.
Implemented validation for fields like email and password to enhance data integrity.
Connected the form to the backend API for handling user registrations.
Added error handling to provide a smoother user experience.
# Milestone 6: Secure Authentication Implementation
Integrated JWT-based authentication to verify and manage user sessions.
Created protected routes, ensuring only authorized users can access certain pages.
Implemented password hashing using bcrypt.js for enhanced security.
Developed API endpoints for user login and logout functionality.
Enabled persistent authentication, allowing users to stay logged in through token storage.
With this milestone, weâ€™ve built a strong authentication system to protect user data and secure API access.
